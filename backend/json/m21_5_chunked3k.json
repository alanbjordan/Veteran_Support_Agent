corrective actions and reporting\n - time limit for corrective action\n - indicating when re-adjudication is not appropriate\n - clearing DROC’s Quality Review Team (QRT) coach’s responsibility for corrective action\n - correcting DROC’s QRT coach’s responsibility for corrective action\n - responsible employee’s responsibility for corrective action\n - responsible employee’s coach’s responsibility for corrective action, and\n - correction of local quality reviews.\n\n\nChange Date\n===========\n\n\n3.B.5.a.  Outcome of National Reviews\n=====================================\n\nDROCs will learn the outcome of a OAR QA assessment that results in an error via QMS.  In QMS, the “notified date” shown on the correction record is the date OAR QA notified the DROC of the error in QMS.  DROCs will learn the outcome of an OAR QA assessment that results in an error via QMS.\n\n\n3.B.5.b.  Clearing DROC vs. Correcting DROC\n===========================================\n\n\n3.B.5.c.  Identified Responsible Employee\n=========================================\n\n\n3.B.5.d.  Action to Take Following Notification of a National Error\n===================================================================\n\nThe clearing DROC’s Quality Review Team (QRT) coach, or their designee, will review the national error cited to determine if a reconsideration request will be submitted.\n\n\n3.B.5.e.  EP 930 Establishment Requirements\n===========================================\n\n - The National Quality Review special issue indicator is a ‘Do Not Recall’ (DNR) indicator that prevents National Work Queue (NWQ) recall until the special issue is removed in conjunction with an appropriate transaction.\n - If the EP associated with the claim reviewed for quality is still pending, which is likely following a local quality review, then an EP 930 is not necessary.  The DROC should complete corrective action, to include mentoring and entering a Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) note, under the existing EP.\n\n - The DROC should not establish an EP 930 unless OAR QA upholds an error on reconsideration.\n - EP 930 is not necessary if OAR QA overturns an error on reconsideration.\n\n - M21-4, Appendix B, and\n - VBMS User Guide.\n\n\n3.B.5.f.  Corrective Actions and Reporting\n==========================================\n\n\n3.B.5.g.  Time Limit for Corrective Action\n==========================================\n\n\n3.B.5.h.  Indicating When Re-Adjudication Is Not Appropriate\n============================================================\n\n\n3.B.5.i.  Clearing DROC’s Quality Review Team (QRT) Coach’s Responsibility for Corrective Action\n================================================================================================\n\n - When the identified correcting DROC is also the clearing DROC, the clearing DROC will maintain ownership of the correction record(s) and must take corrective actions.\n - When the identified correcting DROC is a DROC other than the clearing DROC, the clearing DROC’s QRT coach must transfer the error correction record(s) to the correcting DROC’s QMS Coach Team by selecting “change owner” for each error correction record that needs to be transferred.\n\n\n3.B.5.j. Correcting DROC's QRT Coach’s Responsibility for Corrective Action\n===========================================================================\n\n - notification, QMS actions, and EP 930 establishment with claim attributes\n - changing ownership of the national error correction record in QMS, and\n - ensuring the DROC takes corrective actions within five business days.\n\n - Send notification (according to local procedures) of the error correction to the identified responsible employee, and ensure that a copy is sent to the employee’s supervisor. When there is no identified responsible employee, or the identified responsible employee is no longer of record at the DROC, use local procedures to determine who at the DROC is responsible for the corrective action.\n - When there is no identified responsible employee, or the identified responsible employee is no longer of record at the DROC, use local procedures to determine who at the DROC is responsible for the corrective action.\n - In QMS, mark the error correction record as “notified” when notification is sent to the employee and accept the error correction(s) by marking the “Error Accepted” box within each associated error correction record.\n - Ensure that the DROC establishes an EP 930 with the appropriate claim label, along with the National Quality Review special issue indicator and assigns it to the appropriate employee in VBMS.  Choose the appropriate claim label from the following selections:  Correction of National Quality Error – Appeals Correction of National Quality Error – Non-Rating Correction of National Quality Error – Rating\n - Correction of National Quality Error – Appeals\n - Correction of National Quality Error – Non-Rating\n - Correction of National Quality Error – Rating\n\n - When there is no identified responsible employee, or the identified responsible employee is no longer of record at the DROC, use local procedures to determine who at the DROC is responsible for the corrective action.\n\n - Correction of National Quality Error – Appeals\n - Correction of National Quality Error – Non-Rating\n - Correction of National Quality Error – Rating\n\n\n3.B.5.k.  Responsible Employee’s Responsibility for Corrective Action\n=====================================================================\n\n\n3.B.5.l.  Responsible Employee’s Coach’s Responsibility for Corrective Action\n=============================================================================\n\n\n3.B.5.m.  Correction of Local Quality Reviews\n=============================================\n\n - The appropriate EP 930 claim label for local quality reviews is Correction of Local Quality Error.\n - The appropriate DNR special issue is Local Quality Review.\n\n - the requirement to enter a VBMS note and how to enter one, please seeM21-4, Appendix B, andVBMS User Guide.\n - M21-4, Appendix B, and\n - VBMS User Guide.\n - QRT and local quality reviews, see M21-5, Chapter 3, Section A.\n\n - M21-4, Appendix B, and\n - VBMS User Guide.\n\n\n6.  Reconsideration Requests\n============================\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n -

In these cases, OAR QA will uphold the error, but reclassify it in QMS to reflect the correct classification.\n - This process will not affect the DROC’s right to ask for an additional reconsideration using the secondary process detailed below.\n\n\n3.B.6.e.  Formal Reconsideration Requests\n=========================================\n\n - supporting statutes\n - regulations\n - CAVC Opinions\n - GC Opinions\n - manual, or\n - other appropriate citations.\n\n\n3.B.6.f.  Secondary Reconsideration Requests\n============================================\n\n -

No more than 25 hours of station-selected training allotted centrally by OAR to account for VA Central Office quality calls, quality practicums, mandatory hour overages and other centrally assigned items.\n\n - Employees may exceed 65 total annual hours of training only if OAR or Compensation Service centrally assign excess FY mandated or station-selected training hours, or if excess hours account for designated specialized processor training. However, station-selected training cannot exceed 40 hours (15 DROC-selected hours and 25 centrally-allotted hours).\n - As noted in the VBA Availability Playbook and M21-5, Chapter 2, Topic 2.j, Directors may approve up to 10 hours of additional training, per person, per year. OAR must approved requests for training in excess of the Director's approval authority.\n - Trainees do not fall under this requirement; while they receive the same mandated curricula assignments, they do not have station-selected training requirements and are not included in required NTC reporting.\n\n - The VBA Availability Playbook, see M21-5, Chapter 2, Topic 2.j\n - Compensation Service training requirements, see M21-3, Part I,  Section A\n - OAR FY mandated training, see M21-5, Chapter 2, Topic 2.b\n - OAR station-selected training, see M21-5, Chapter 2, Topic 2.c, and\n - For a complete list of all curricula, sub-curricula, and assigned mandated training, see the OAR FY25 Mandated Courses Released spreadsheet available on the VBA Learning Catalog.\n\n\n2.3.b.  Training Requirements for CAs\n=====================================\n\n\n\n\n2.3.c.  Training Requirements for VSR and RVSR Trainees\n=======================================================\n\n\n\n - VIP completion credit\n - Compensation Service VAT mandated curricula\n - OAR VAT mandated curricula\n - FY25 Compensation Service mandated training items, and\n - FY25 OAR mandated training items.\n\n\n2.3.d.  WARTAC VSR and RVSR New Hire Training Requirements\n==========================================================\n\n\n\n - OAR WARTAC Pre VSR Graduate Hires (VBA-722): TMS will automatically assign the Compensation Service Pre & Pre/Post VSR VAT curriculum, OAR Pre & Pre/Post VSR VAT curriculum, the Compensation Service Pre VSR FY directed curriculum, and the OAR Pre VSR FY mandated curriculum to employees placed in this cohort.\n - OAR WARTAC Post VSR Graduate Hires (VBA-793): TMS will automatically assign the Compensation Service Post VSR VAT curriculum, OAR Post VSR VAT curriculum, Compensation Service Post VSR FY mandated curriculum, and the OAR Post VSR FY mandated curriculum.

As a reminder, add trainees to the OAR New Hire cohorts and then HCS will centrally add employees to the primary cohorts at the end of their trainee status.\n - Do not add employees to multiple OAR primary cohorts; only add them to their position-specific cohort. For example, do not add SVSRs to the Pre/Post VSR and SVSR cohort (only add them to SVSR), and do not add DROs to the RVSR and DRO cohort (only add them to DRO).\n - It is mandatory for DROCs to add Assistant Coaches and Coaches to one or both management primary cohorts. DROCs may include DROC Managers and Assistant DROC Managers on an optional basis.\n - Training Managers are responsible for removing individuals that leave one position and enter a trainee status in a new position from TMS primary cohorts. For example, if a VSR leaves their position and becomes an RVSR trainee, the Training Manager must remove the individual from the VSR primary cohort and register the individual for the next available RVSR VIP session. HCS will centrally add the individual to the RVSR primary cohort upon completion of trainee status 12 months after graduating VIP training.\n - Training Managers are responsible for entering experienced employees from another division that have already completed their entry-level, trainee period into the appropriate OAR NTC primary cohort. For example, if a VSC VSR transfers to the DROC, the Training Manager must remove the VSR from the Compensation Service VSR primary cohort and add them to the appropriate DROC VSR primary cohort. Experienced VSRs and RVSRs from other divisions must complete DROC-specific training via the OAR NTC mandated and VAT curricula.\n\n - For a complete list of all curricula, sub-curricula, and assigned mandated training, see the OAR FY25 Mandated Courses Released spreadsheet available on the VBA Learning Catalog.\n - For more information on one-time mandated specialized training assignments for AQRSs and RQRSs, see M21-5, Chapter 2, Topic 4.k.\n\n\n2.4.g.

Brown, 5 Vet.App. 458 (1993) for more information)\n - written testimony from an eyewitness that is substantially identical to a statement already on file\n - a layperson’s assertion about the cause (but not the onset) of a disability, or\n - medical evidence that reveals the existence of a disability when previous evidence already supported its existence.\n\n\n5.

It allows re-weighing of that prior evidence, so the decision maker may make a new decision without regard to the earlier one. The reviewer cannot use DoO to revise the prior decision in a manner that would be less advantageous to the claimant. However, the reviewer may use CUE to adversely revise a decision when necessary.\n\nTo minimize overpayments, underpayments, and inaccurately continuing beneficiaries for benefits, DROCMs or their designees must log each CUE decision in the Compensation Service CUE Microsoft SharePoint site. See M21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A.3.f.\n\nReference: For more information on\n\n - the authorities for making new decisions on HLRs, see 38 CFR 3.2601(i) and (j),\n - CUE, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart ii,  5.A, and\n - DoO, see 38 CFR 3.105(b).\n\n\n5.1.j. Difference of Opinion vs. Duty to Assist Error\n=====================================================\n\nA true error in VA's duty to assist (DTA) contains two components: VA's obligation under 38 CFR 3.159 to assist in obtaining certain evidence and VA's failure to do so at the time of the prior decision.\n\nThe exercise of a difference of opinion may lead to additional development, but that development does not necessarily mean that the prior decision failed to properly assist the claimant. The HLR reviewer has the authority to weigh the same evidence differently than the earlier adjudicator and may change the previous decision based on difference of opinion. If the difference of opinion results in the need for an examination or further development, then the reviewer must document this on the VA Form 20-0999, Higher Level Review Return. The reviewer must return the case for additional development resulting from a DoO using that same VA Form 20-0999. However, this return does not constitute a DTA error as the previous decision was not necessarily incorrect. Rather, the amended decision mandates additional development to resolve, as is often the case, certain downstream issues.\n\nExample: The HLR is requesting service connection (SC) for a condition. The reviewer, weighing the evidence differently than the earlier decision maker, now decides to order an examination based on the evidence of record. The reviewer will document the need for further development (a request for examination based on the review) under DoO, document the favorable findings as necessary, and then return the request for development so VA may order the examination. When VA obtains that examination, the RVSR will formally decide if a grant is warranted based on the examination. If so, the RVSR will assign the evaluation and effective date.\n\nRationale: The prior decisionmaker was not obligated to order an examination, as it was not necessary to decide the claim. Hence, the prior decision contained no DTA error. However, once the reviewer decided to grant SC based on DoO, VA was required to seek additional development to fairly decide the downstream issues.\n\nReference: For more information on DTA errors, see M21-5, Chapter 5, Topic 5.a.\n\n\n2.  Initial Actions Upon Requests for HLRs\n==========================================\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n - definition of a complete request for an HLR\n - initial actions to take with an HLR request\n - handling requests to conduct HLRs at specific offices\n - actions to take if an HLR is erroneously established, and\n - addressing IU in an HLR.\n\n\nChange Date\n===========\n\n\n5.2.a.  Definition of a  Complete Request for an HLR\n====================================================\n\n - name of the claimant and the relationship to the Veteran, if applicable\n - signature of the claimant, or a person legally authorized to sign for the claimant\n - date of the underlying decision for which review is requested, and\n - specific issues for which review is requested.\n\n - completed requests, see 38 CFR 3.2601, and\n - timeliness of review requests, see M21-5, Chapter 5, Topic 1.c.\n\n\n5.2.b.  Initial Actions to Take With an HLR Request\n===================================================\n\n\n5.2.c.  Handling Requests to Conduct HLRs at Specific Offices\n=============================================================\n\nWhen unable to accommodate the claimant’s request regarding venue for the HLR, insert the following paragraph in the introduction of the decision document:\n\nYou requested to have your higher-level review conducted at the same office that decided your claim.  Unfortunately, we were unable to fulfill your request because that office does not have personnel available to conduct higher-level reviews (see 38 CFR 3.2601(e)). Accordingly, we conducted your review at an office with the appropriate personnel available.\n\nReferences:  For more information on where VA may conduct HLRs, see 38 CFR 3.2601.\n\n\n5.2.d. Actions to Take if an HLR is Erroneously Established\n===========================================================\n\nAn HLR EP 030 is erroneously established and NO action is required\n\nAdd a VBMS claim note explaining why the EP 030 should be cancelled and identify that no corrective action is needed.\n\nCancel the EP 030 in SHARE and,\n\nE-mail supervisor to advise that the higher-level reviewer cancelled the EP 030, completed a VBMS note providing cancellation details and advise that no further action is necessary.\n\nAdd VBMS claim note explaining why the EP 030 should be cancelled and identify in the note any necessary corrective action, such as sending out a letter.\n\nE-mail supervisor to advise that the higher-level reviewer documented the necessary action to take in a VBMS claim note.\n\nThe supervisor will then assign that necessary action to a claims processor on the pending EP 030.\n\n\n5.2.e. Addressing IU in an HLR\n==============================\n\nIU has been expressly claimed, or reasonably raised, and that documentation and/or evidence falls within the scope of the closed record review\n\nConsider IU as a contention within the HLR and render a decision accordingly\n\nIU cannot be considered as part of the HLR because it falls outside the scope of the closed record review.\n\nIf the underlying condition(s) are all outside the scope of the HLR, IU must be developed and decided under a separate EP in VBMS.\n\nIf all of the underlying conditions are within the scope of the HLR,\n\n - Advise of the prohibition of considering new evidence outside the closed evidentiary record\n\nIf there are multiple underlying conditions with some, but not all, falling within the scope of the HLR,\n\n - Advise of the prohibition of considering new evidence outside the closed evidentiary record.\n - The issues outside the scope of the HLR should be adjudicated in accordance with M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 3.B.\n\n - the role of VA Form 21-8940 in development of IU claims, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 3.B.1.b, and\n - reasonably raised claims for IU, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 3.B.1.f\n\n\n3.  Requests for Informal Conferences\n=====================================\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n - definition of informal conferences\n - overview of informal conferences\n - initial actions\n - contacting requesters of informal conferences\n - unsuccessful initial attempts to contact the requesters\n - unsuccessful second attempts to contact the requesters, and\n - actions to take with successful contact\n\n\nChange Date\n===========\n\n\n5.3.a.  Definition of Informal Conferences\n==========================================\n\n\n5.3.b.  Overview of Informal Conferences\n========================================\n\n\n5.3.c.  Initial Actions\n=======================\n\n\n5.3.d.  Contacting Requesters of Informal Conferences\n=====================================================\n\n\n5.3.e.         Unsuccessful Initial Attempts to Contact the Requesters\n======================================================================\n\n - if possible, leave a general voicemail message requesting a return call with a VA contact phone number\n - add the date of the first attempt to the existing informal conference tracked item under Follow Up 1 (not the closure date)\n - document the unsuccessful contact on VA Form 27-0820, Report of General Information\n - add a permanent note in VBMS with the reason for the call and, depending on local scheduling protocols, request the Informal Conference Coordinator document the requester’s or representative’s availability if either person calls back (see sample text below), and\n - ensure that the suspense date will expire in three business days.\n\n - If the first attempt is made on Monday, the first business day is Tuesday, the second business day is Wednesday, and the third business day is Thursday (excluding any holidays). If no response is received before Thursday, the second attempt can be made on Thursday.\n - If the first attempt is made on Wednesday, the first business day is Thursday, the second business day is Friday, and the third business day is Monday (excluding any holidays). If no response is received before Monday, the second attempt can be made on Monday.\n\n\n5.3.f.  Unsuccessful Second Attempts to Contact the Requesters\n==============================================================\n\n - document the unsuccessful contact on VA Form 27-0820\n - enter the date of the final unsuccessful contact attempt in the \"Closed Date\" tracked item field\n - add a permanent note of the unsuccessful attempt in VBMS\n - if applicable, provide a copy of VA Form 27-0820 to the requester's accredited representative and associate it with the eFolder, and\n - the higher-level reviewer with authority over the issues can then render a final decision on the HLR.\n\n\n5.3.g.  Actions to Take After Successful Contact\n================================================\n\n - schedule and/or conduct the informal conference, preferably within 7 calendar days of initial contact with the Veteran and/or representative - whenever possible, the decision maker may conduct the conference when successful contact is first made, but only if the claimant or representative (whichever is identified on the VA Form 20-0996 for contact) feels comfortable to hold the conference at that time; the decision maker must advise that the informal conference may be scheduled for a later date\n - prior to the informal conference, the decision maker should conduct a  review of the contested decision so that they are familiar with all issues and the applicable evidentiary record\n - follow the instructions on the HLR Informal Conference Worksheet by reading to the claimant or representative the script on the purpose of the conference\n - complete an HLR Informal Conference Worksheet, describing the specific error(s) of fact or law identified by the claimant or representative\n - enter the date the informal conference was held in the \"Received Date\" tracked item field\n - complete a new decision for all HLR issues\n - if applicable, provide a copy of this worksheet to the requester’s accredited representative, and\n - associate the worksheet with the Veteran's eFolder.\n\nStep\n\nAction\n\n1\n\nContact the claimant or representative by telephone to explain that the employee who conducted the informal conference is unable to render the final decision. Only one attempt to contact the claimant and/or representative is required.\n\n2\n\nAsk the claimant to elect one of the following options:\n\n - take part in a new informal conference with a different decision maker\n - forego a new informal conference, with the understanding that the new decision",

The appropriate claim label for the EP 600 is ncessary based on M21-4, Appendix C to ensure the claim is correctly routed by NWQ. However, the final action on contested claims should be taken by the DROCs upon expiration of the due process period. In order to properly maintain DROC control, DROCs must follow the below, as appropriate:\n\n - For due process issues related to agent/attorney fees, where there is a failure to make funds available on DROC-related workload, agent/attorney fee coordinators (AAFC) must use the claim label \"600 AFPM -

If the AAFC can reasonably identify the Veteran/claimant – notwithstanding the lack of a VA file number or SSN on the fee agreement – and an award has not yet been released to the claimant, accept the fee agreement as valid. If, after all past-due benefits have been released to the claimant, VA discovers that there was a fee agreement that had not been associated with the claims folder, the agent's or attorney’s failure to comply with the requirement of including the file number or SSN on the fee agreement would be a valid basis for a subsequent decision denying fees.\n - If the AAFC can reasonably identify the Veteran/claimant – notwithstanding the lack of a VA file number or SSN on the fee agreement – and an award has not yet been released to the claimant, accept the fee agreement as valid.\n - If, after all past-due benefits have been released to the claimant, VA discovers that there was a fee agreement that had not been associated with the claims folder, the agent's or attorney’s failure to comply with the requirement of including the file number or SSN on the fee agreement would be a valid basis for a subsequent decision denying fees.\n\n - If the AAFC can reasonably identify the Veteran/claimant – notwithstanding the lack of a VA file number or SSN on the fee agreement – and an award has not yet been released to the claimant, accept the fee agreement as valid.\n - If, after all past-due benefits have been released to the claimant, VA discovers that there was a fee agreement that had not been associated with the claims folder, the agent's or attorney’s failure to comply with the requirement of including the file number or SSN on the fee agreement would be a valid basis for a subsequent decision denying fees.\n\n\n8.A.1.c.  Definition of Direct Pay Fee Agreement\n================================================\n\n - the direct pay fee agreements, see 38 CFR 14.636(g)(2)\n - past-due benefits, see 38 CFR 14.636(h)(3), and\n - fee agreements that do not meet the requirements of a direct pay fee agreement, see 38 CFR 14.636(g)(2) and (3).\n\n\n8.A.1.d.  Additional Requirements for Direct Pay Fee Agreements\n===============================================================\n\n - clearly state that VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of awarded past-due benefits\n - specify a fee amount that is presumptively reasonable, and\n - be timely filed.\n\n - the requirements for fee agreements generally, see   38 CFR 14.636(g), and   M21-5, Chapter 8, Section A, 1.b\n - 38 CFR 14.636(g), and\n - M21-5, Chapter 8, Section A, 1.b\n - additional requirements for direct pay fee agreements, see   38 CFR 14.636(g)(2) and (3), and   38 CFR 14.636(h)\n - 38 CFR 14.636(g)(2) and (3), and\n - 38 CFR 14.636(h)\n - the period to use for calculating past-due benefits, see   38 CFR 14.636(h)(3), and   M21-5, Chapter 8, Section B, 2.c.\n - 38 CFR 14.636(h)(3), and\n - M21-5, Chapter 8, Section B, 2.c.\n - withholding, paying fees, and corrective action for failure to withhold prior to the January 30, 2020, decision in Rosinski, see the historical M21-1, Part I, 3.C attachment Historical_M21-1I_3_SecC_1-24-20.docx\n - presumptions on reasonableness of a fee, see 38 CFR 14.636(f), and\n - the process for considering entitlement to direct payment of fees, see M21-5, Chapter 8, Section B, 1.a-c.\n\n - 38 CFR 14.636(g), and\n - M21-5, Chapter 8, Section A, 1.b\n\n - 38 CFR 14.636(g)(2) and (3), and\n - 38 CFR 14.636(h)\n\n - 38 CFR 14.636(h)(3), and\n - M21-5, Chapter 8, Section B, 2.c.\n\n\n8.A.1.e.  Fee Amount Permitted for Direct Payment of Fees\n=========================================================\n\n - In a case involving a required offset or reduction, as discussed in M21-5, Chapter 8, Section B, 2.e, an agreed fee of 20 percent or less of the past-due benefit awarded is not unreasonable because the calculated fee will amount to more than 20 percent of the reduced non-recurrent amount payable (if any) to the claimant from the award at that time.\n - Expenses are not payable directly to the agent or attorney out of past-due benefits.\n - If a non-direct pay fee agreement (agreement specifies payment is to be made directly by the Veteran, not by VA, out of past due benefits) is received, an invalid fee agreement letter is not required.\n\n - fees that are permitted generally, see 38 CFR 14.636(e)\n - presumptions regarding fees, see 38 CFR 14.636(f)\n - all requirements for direct payment of fees, see 38 CFR 14.636(g) and (h), and\n - requirements for fee agreements that do not meet the requirements for a direct pay fee agreement, see 38 CFR 14.636(g)(2) and (3).\n\n\n8.A.1.f. When a Direct Pay Fee Agreement Must Be Filed\n======================================================\n\n - VA applies the postmark rule of 38 CFR 20.110 to determine when the fee agreement is received.\n - A fee agreement is fully executed once it is signed by both parties (the agent/attorney and the claimant/beneficiary). Measure the 30-day period from the date of the final signature applied to the document.\n - Unless there is reason to question the authenticity of the fee agreement, the policy described in the above paragraph allows ROs to accept a fee agreement outside of the 30-day timeliness provision so long as the agent/attorney on the fee agreement is still the current representative.\n - It is appropriate to request further evidence or verification from a claimant if there is substantial reason to challenge the submission due to lack of timeliness.\n\n - checking fee agreements, see M21-5, Chapter 8, Section A, 1.b.\n - the action required when a direct pay fee agreement is untimely filed, see M21-5, Chapter 8, Section A, 3.d, and\n - filing requirements for fee agreements that do not meet the requirements of direct pay fee agreements, see 38 CFR 14.636(g)(3).\n\n\n8.A.1.g.  Determining the Work on Which a Fee Can Be Charged – Scope of Case or Claim\n=====================================================================================\n\n - on which notification was provided in the AOJ’s initial decision, and\n - for which a review option was properly elected.\n\n - issues within the scope of a claim, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A, and\n - special considerations on fees for representation on various claim types, see M21-5, Chapter 8, Section A, 1.h - k.\n\n\n8.A.1.h.  Fees for Representation Involving Supplemental Claims\n===============================================================\n\n\n8.A.1.i.  Fees for Representation Involving Claims for Increase\n===============================================================\n\n\n8.A.1.j.  Fees for Representation Involving Requests to Revise Based on Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE)\n==========================================================================================================\n\n - a claimant’s request to revise a prior decision on the basis of CUE as long as notice of the decision being challenged based on CUE was issued on or after February 19, 2019, or\n - a claim",
